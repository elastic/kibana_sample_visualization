# Outdated

This repository is outdated and not up-to-date with recent Kibana versions anymore.

You can find a sample Kibana visualization plugin within the
[Kibana respository](https://github.com/elastic/kibana/tree/master/test/plugin_functional/plugins/kbn_tp_custom_visualizations)
now, which is automatically tested against Kibana, and thus up-to-date. Make sure to select
the appropriate version/branch you're developing against.
